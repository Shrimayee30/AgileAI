1. INTRODUCTION
The demand for online food ordering has rapidly increased due to changing consumer preferences,
time constraints, and the convenience of home delivery. Traditional dine-in and phone-based
ordering methods are limited by communication gaps, long wait times, and lack of transparency in
order tracking. Customers expect a seamless digital experience that allows them to browse menus,
customize orders, and receive timely delivery updates.
DineEasy is a web-based food ordering system designed to connect customers with restaurants
through an intuitive online platform. The application enables users to browse menus, place orders,
and track delivery status while providing restaurant owners with tools to manage orders and menu
items effectively. The system aims to enhance ordering efficiency and improve customer
satisfaction through automated and streamlined workflows.
2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
Many restaurants rely on manual or phone-based ordering processes, which often lead to
miscommunication, delayed preparation, and order inaccuracies. Customers have limited visibility
into menu availability and order status, resulting in dissatisfaction and operational inefficiencies.
There is a need for a centralized digital platform that reduces friction between users and restaurants
while improving order management and tracking.
