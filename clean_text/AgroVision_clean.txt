1. INTRODUCTION
Agriculture remains a primary source of livelihood across many regions, yet crop
losses due to plant diseases continue to threaten food security and economic
stability. Traditional diagnosis relies heavily on manual inspection, which is slow,
inconsistent, and inaccessible in remote farming areas. AgroVision introduces an
automated convolutional neural network (CNN) based detection system capable of
identifying common leaf based diseases with high accuracy, enabling timely
intervention and improved agricultural outcomes.
2. LITERATURE REVIEW
Deep learning has demonstrated strong performance in agricultural disease
detection. Studies using the PlantVillage dataset report accuracy above 99 percent
with fine tuned models such as ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0. However, most
research focuses on controlled experimentation without deployment in production.
AgroVision differentiates itself by implementing a full pipeline including model
export, API development, containerization, monitoring, and optional edge
deployment.
3. DATASET AND PREPROCESSING
The PlantVillage dataset is selected due to its labeled collection of more than
54,000 leaf images across crops including tomato, potato, and maize. 3.1 Data
Source Dataset: Kaggle PlantVillage Plant Disease dataset 3.2 Preprocessing
Steps: - Resize images to 224x224 pixels - Normalize pixel values using ImageNet
mean and standard deviation - Split into train, validation, and test sets using 70,
15, 15 ratio - Apply augmentation such as random rotation, horizontal flip, and
brightness adjustments 3.3 Data Challenges - Uniform background may limit
generalization to real field images - Field dataset collection is planned as future
work.
4. MODEL ARCHITECTURE

Page 3
A transfer learning approach with ResNet50 is adopted. Main components: - Input:
224x224 RGB images - Convolutional backbone: residual blocks pretrained on
ImageNet - Global average pooling layer - Fully connected output layer with
softmax activation over disease classes Hyperparameters: - Optimizer: Adam -
Learning rate: 1e-4 with cosine learning rate schedule - Batch size: 32 - Epochs:
25 with early stopping on validation loss - Regularization: dropout with probability
0.3 and L2 weight decay.
5. TRAINING AND EVALUATION
Training is performed using PyTorch with GPU acceleration. On the held out test
set the model achieves: - Accuracy: 98.4 percent - Precision: 98.1 percent - Recall:
97.9 percent - F1 score: 98.0 percent Confusion matrix analysis shows occasional
confusion between visually similar diseases such as early and late blight, indicating
that more diverse field images could further improve robustness.
6. DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE
AgroVision includes a complete deployment pipeline so that the trained model can
be used in real scenarios. 6.1 Model Conversion - Export trained PyTorch model to
ONNX format - Validate exported model using ONNX Runtime 6.2 API
Development - Implement a FastAPI service with a POST /predict endpoint -
Accept image uploads, run preprocessing, and return predicted class and
confidence 6.3 Containerization - Create a Dockerfile with a lightweight Python
base image - Use a multi stage build to install dependencies and keep the final
image small - Expose the FastAPI application via Uvicorn 6.4 CI and CD -
Configure GitHub Actions to run unit tests on every push - Build and push Docker
images to a container registry - Optionally deploy to a cloud service such as Azure
Container Apps or AWS ECS 6.5 Monitoring and Logging - Add logging of
prediction requests and response times - Expose Prometheus metrics for request
count, latency, and error rates - Build Grafana dashboards to visualize live
performance and usage trends 6.6 Edge Deployment - Optimize ONNX model with
quantization to reduce model size - Run inference on a Raspberry Pi or similar
edge device - Use local caching of classes to support offline predictions.
7. RISK ANALYSIS AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Key risks include incorrect predictions leading to wrong treatment decisions, bias
toward specific crops or environments, and over reliance on AI without expert
validation. To mitigate these issues, AgroVision is positioned as a decision support
tool, not a replacement for agronomists. Users should be informed about model
limitations, and future versions should incorporate feedback loops for continuous
improvement.
8. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Limitations of the current version: - Performance on noisy, cluttered real field
images is lower than on lab style images - Limited coverage of crop species Future
work: - Collecting field images across different regions and conditions - Extending
to more crops and disease types - Packaging the system into a mobile application
for farmers - Adding an automated retraining pipeline using newly collected labeled
data.
9. CONCLUSION
AgroVision demonstrates how a deep learning based crop disease recognition
model can be taken from research stage to a deployed, containerized service with
monitoring and optional edge deployment. The project highlights the full life cycle
of applied machine learning, from dataset preparation and training to operations
and maintenance.
