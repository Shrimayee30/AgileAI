1. INTRODUCTION
Modern networks generate large volumes of traffic that must be monitored
continuously to detect cyber threats, unusual activity, or operational failures.
Traditional rule based intrusion systems struggle to detect unknown attack patterns
and adapt to evolving network behavior. SmartDetect is an anomaly detection
system that uses an autoencoder based machine learning model to identify
abnormal traffic patterns and support real time alerting. The project demonstrates a
complete workflow including dataset processing, model training, evaluation, and
deployment to an edge device for low latency inference.
2. LITERATURE REVIEW
Machine learning based systems have shown improved detection of novel
intrusions compared to signature based methods. Studies using datasets such as
the UNSW NB15 and NSL KDD have demonstrated strong performance using
autoencoders and clustering models. However, many research efforts remain
focused on offline evaluation without deployment in constrained environments.
SmartDetect targets practical feasibility by optimizing model size and enabling real
time execution outside of cloud infrastructure.
3. DATASET AND PREPROCESSING
The UNSW NB15 dataset is used due to its modern representation of normal and
attack traffic. 3.1 Data Source Dataset obtained from Australian Cyber Security
Centre repository. 3.2 Preprocessing Steps Normalize numerical features using
standard scaling. Encode categorical fields using one hot encoding. Split into
training, validation, and test sets using 60, 20, 20 ratio. Remove duplicate and
corrupted records. 3.3 Challenges Traffic imbalance between normal and rare
attack classes. High dimensionality requiring feature reduction.
4. MODEL ARCHITECTURE
An autoencoder neural network is trained to reconstruct normal traffic patterns.
Main components include: Input layer matching feature dimensions. Encoder

layers reducing dimensionality. Latent bottleneck representation. Decoder layers
reconstructing original features. Hyperparameters: Optimizer: Adam. Learning rate:
1e minus 4. Batch size: 64. Epochs: 50 with early stopping. Activation functions:
ReLU and sigmoid. Loss function: Mean squared error.
5. TRAINING AND EVALUATION
Training is conducted using PyTorch with GPU acceleration. Evaluation results on
test data: Reconstruction error threshold selected using validation distribution.
Detection performance: Precision: 91.4 percent. Recall: 89.7 percent. F1 score:
90.2 percent. False positives mainly occur during high traffic spikes unrelated to
attacks.
6. DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE
SmartDetect is deployed using a lightweight inference pipeline. 6.1 Model
Conversion Export trained PyTorch model to TorchScript. Validate converted
model using CPU runtime. 6.2 Edge Inference Service FastAPI service exposes
predict endpoint. Requests processed locally on edge device. 6.3 Containerization
Docker image built using Python slim base. Final image optimized through
dependency pruning. 6.4 CI and CD GitHub Actions executes formatting checks
and test scripts. Container pushed to registry for controlled rollout. 6.5 Monitoring
and Logging Local logs for anomaly counts and timestamps. Optional Prometheus
metrics for central monitoring. 6.6 Edge Deployment Deployed to Raspberry Pi
class device. Quantization reduces model size by approximately 40 percent
without major accuracy loss.
7. RISK ANALYSIS AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Potential risks include false detection influencing network operations, bias against
rare but legitimate traffic patterns, and lack of transparency in anomaly scoring.
Model results must be interpreted alongside domain expertise, and automated
response systems should include safety checks.

8. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Limitations include performance drop during sudden non malicious traffic changes
and limited attack type coverage. Future enhancements: Integration with real time
packet inspection. Adaptive thresholding using drift detection. Support for
additional intrusion datasets. On device incremental learning.
9. CONCLUSION
SmartDetect demonstrates a practical implementation of anomaly based intrusion
detection using deep learning and edge deployment. The project highlights the
feasibility of running lightweight inference without reliance on cloud resources,
supporting secure and scalable network monitoring.
