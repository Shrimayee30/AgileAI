1. INTRODUCTION
Retail organizations require accurate demand forecasting and real time insights to
optimize inventory, reduce stockouts, and improve revenue outcomes. Traditional
reporting workflows rely on delayed batch processes and static spreadsheets,
resulting in slow decision cycles. SalesPulse is a data driven forecasting and
analytics platform developed over a 3 week sprint cycle to provide automated
insights, interactive dashboards, and short term sales predictions.
2. PROJECT TIMELINE AND PHASES
2.1 Week 1: Data Exploration and Pipeline Setup
Activities: Collected historical retail sales dataset with multiple store and product
attributes. Performed exploratory data analysis including trend decomposition and
seasonal pattern identification. Built preprocessing pipeline for cleaning,
aggregation, outlier removal, and feature extraction. Evaluated baseline statistical
forecasting approaches.
2.2 Week 2: Model Development and Evaluation
Activities: Implemented ARIMA and Prophet models for short term forecasting.
Compared performance using mean absolute percentage error and root mean
squared error. Performed hyperparameter tuning and rolling window validation.
Generated forward looking forecast outputs for dashboard integration.
2.3 Week 3: Dashboard Integration and Testing
Activities: Developed Power BI dashboard with interactive filters and visualizations.
Connected processed dataset to dashboard refresh pipeline. Added visual
components including forecast overlays and store level comparison. Conducted
functional, performance, and user acceptance testing.

3. DATASET DETAILS
The dataset includes: Daily sales records across multiple retail stores. Product
identifiers, categories, and promotional markers. Attributes such as price, quantity,
and regional segmentation. Date range covering multiple seasonal cycles.
3.1 Data Challenges
Challenges identified: Missing entries during holidays. Large spikes during
promotional events. Non uniform distribution across stores.
4. MODELING APPROACH
4.1 Model Selection
Approaches evaluated: Naive baseline model. ARIMA for short term trend
forecasting. Prophet for seasonality heavy patterns. Random forest regression for
feature based prediction.
4.2 Final Model Justification
Prophet selected for: Automatic handling of yearly and weekly seasonality. Fast
training suitable for periodic updates. Robustness against irregular gaps.
5. EVALUATION AND RESULTS
Performance achieved: Mean absolute percentage error: 5.8 percent. Root mean
squared error: 12.4. Rolling forecast stability maintained across validation
windows. Insights revealed seasonal peak months and declining product
categories.

6. DASHBOARD DEVELOPMENT
6.1 Power BI Components
Dashboard includes: Store wise trend graphs. Forecast versus actual comparison
chart. Top performing product matrix. Dynamic slicers for date, region, and product
category.
6.2 Refresh and Data Flow
Process: Preprocessing pipeline outputs final dataset. Power BI refresh configured
on scheduled interval. Updated forecasts pushed to dashboard for continuous
visibility.
7. IMPLEMENTATION AND TESTING
7.1 Functional Testing
Validated: Data integrity and preprocessing consistency. Model output correctness.
Dashboard filter behavior and refresh reliability.
7.2 Performance Testing
Measured: Model training time under 3 minutes. Dashboard refresh latency below
10 seconds. Memory usage during preprocessing.
8. LIMITATIONS
Limitations identified: No real time data streaming in current version. Forecast
accuracy declines beyond 30 day horizon. Model does not yet factor external
variables such as weather or marketing campaigns.

9. FUTURE DEVELOPMENT PLAN
Planned enhancements: Integration with live POS streaming systems. LSTM
based neural forecasting. Anomaly detection pipeline. Deployment using FastAPI
and containerization. Role based access controls for dashboard users.
10. CONCLUSION
SalesPulse demonstrates a complete 3 week development cycle including data
exploration, model experimentation, dashboard integration, and evaluation. The
platform provides actionable insights for retail planning and forms a strong
foundation for future expansion into real time forecasting and advanced analytics.
