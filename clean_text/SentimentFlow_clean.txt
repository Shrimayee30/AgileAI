1. INTRODUCTION
Organizations increasingly depend on real time insights from social media,
customer feedback, and live communication channels. Traditional batch
processing pipelines fail to capture rapid sentiment shifts that influence business
decisions. SentimentFlow is a streaming based sentiment analysis system capable
of processing continuous text input and generating real time predictions using a
fine tuned language model. The project demonstrates the complete workflow from
model development to production deployment for live inference.
2. LITERATURE REVIEW
Existing research shows strong performance of transformer based models such as
BERT and DistilBERT for sentiment classification tasks. Most academic studies
evaluate models using offline static datasets like the IMDB and Twitter Sentiment
datasets. However, deployment in real environments requires low latency
inference, streaming input handling, and scalable serving infrastructure.
SentimentFlow bridges this gap by integrating a full deployment stack with
continuous processing capabilities.
3. DATASET AND PREPROCESSING
The project uses a combination of IMDB sentiment dataset and Twitter Sentiment
data. 3.1 Data Source IMDB Movie Reviews dataset from Kaggle Twitter US Airline
Sentiment dataset 3.2 Preprocessing Steps - Text cleaning including lowercasing,
punctuation removal, and URL stripping - Tokenization using BERT tokenizer -
Padding and truncation to fixed sequence length of 128 - Splitting into train,
validation, and test sets using 70, 15, 15 ratio 3.3 Challenges - Presence of
sarcasm and informal language - Imbalanced class distribution in social media text
4. MODEL ARCHITECTURE
A fine tuned DistilBERT model is used for sentiment classification. Main
components: - Transformer encoder layers pretrained on masked language
modeling - Classification head with fully connected layer - Softmax activation over

three classes: positive, negative, neutral Hyperparameters: - Optimizer: AdamW -
Learning rate: 2e minus 5 - Batch size: 16 - Epochs: 3 - Gradient clipping to
prevent exploding gradients
5. TRAINING AND EVALUATION
Training is performed using PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers.
Performance on test data: - Accuracy: 92.6 percent - Precision: 92.1 percent -
Recall: 91.8 percent - F1 score: 91.9 percent Misclassifications primarily occur in
neutral versus mildly negative cases.
6. STREAMING AND DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE
SentimentFlow is designed for continuous ingestion and live inference. 6.1
Streaming Input - Kafka topic receives incoming text events - Consumer service
preprocesses and queues inference requests 6.2 Model Serving - FastAPI service
exposes a POST predict endpoint - Uvicorn handles asynchronous request
processing 6.3 Containerization - Dockerfile built using Python slim base image -
Multi stage build reduces package load - Container pushed to registry for
deployment 6.4 CI and CD - GitHub Actions performs automated linting and testing
- Container published to AWS ECR - Deployment triggered using AWS ECS or
Kubernetes cluster 6.5 Monitoring and Logging - Prometheus tracks request count,
response times, and failures - Grafana dashboards show live sentiment distribution
and throughput 6.6 Scaling Strategy - Horizontal scaling using Kubernetes HPA -
Auto scaling based on CPU and request rate thresholds
7. RISK ANALYSIS AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Key risks include sentiment misclassification affecting automated decisions, bias
toward specific language samples, and misuse for surveillance. To address these
concerns, SentimentFlow is intended as an assistive tool, and model limitations
must be communicated clearly.
8. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE WORK

Limitations: - Accuracy reduces for multilingual and code mixed input -
Dependence on pretrained English model Future improvements: - Support for
multilingual transformers - Real time drift detection and automated retraining -
Integration with social media firehose streams - Sentiment trend forecasting using
time series models
9. CONCLUSION
SentimentFlow demonstrates an end to end real time sentiment analysis pipeline
combining transformer based modeling, streaming ingestion, and scalable
deployment infrastructure. It highlights how modern NLP systems can be applied in
live environments beyond experimental offline evaluation.
