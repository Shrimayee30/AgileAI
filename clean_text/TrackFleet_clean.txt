1. INTRODUCTION
Transportation fleets require continuous monitoring to ensure operational efficiency
and safety. Traditional maintenance practices are reactive and based on fixed
schedules, often resulting in unexpected failures. TrackFleet is an IoT based
system that enables real time vehicle tracking and predictive maintenance using
onboard sensors and analytical processing. The project demonstrates an
academic implementation of sensing, communication, data processing, and
visualization.
2. OBJECTIVES
The primary objectives of TrackFleet are: 1. To design an IoT based system for
real time vehicle location tracking. 2. To collect and analyze engine and motion
parameters. 3. To implement predictive maintenance alerts using threshold based
rules. 4. To develop dashboards for monitoring fleet activity and health status.
3. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
TrackFleet consists of onboard sensing modules, a wireless communication layer,
a backend processing service, and a visualization dashboard. The system
supports real time data acquisition and historical trend analysis.

GPS module for geolocation. Accelerometer (MPU6050) for motion and vibration
detection. Temperature sensor for engine heat monitoring.
4.3 Power Supply
Powered through vehicle battery with voltage regulation.
5. CIRCUIT AND HARDWARE SETUP
Steps: 1. Interface GPS TX/RX pins to ESP32 UART. 2. Connect MPU6050 using
I2C pins. 3. Mount components securely within the vehicle. 4. Perform continuity
and signal tests before deployment.
6. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
6.1 Firmware Workflow
Tasks performed by ESP32 include: WiFi setup and reconnection attempts. GPS
coordinate extraction. Motion and vibration sampling. MQTT publishing at fixed
intervals.
6.2 Data Format
Example payload: { gps_lat: 28.6139, gps_long: 77.2090, vibration: 0.34, temp:
68.2 }
6.3 Topic Structure
MQTT topics follow hierarchy: trackfleet/vehicle1/location
trackfleet/vehicle1/engine

7.2 Database
InfluxDB used for time series data. Retention policies applied for historical storage.
8. DASHBOARD AND VISUALIZATION
Grafana dashboards display: Live vehicle map location. Engine temperature
timeline. Vibration levels to identify abnormal patterns.
9. IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
9.1 Hardware Deployment
Install modules in vehicle. Label units for fleet identification.
9.2 Firmware Deployment
Flash ESP32. Configure network parameters. Test MQTT data transmission.
9.3 Backend Setup
Start MQTT broker. Configure database buckets. Verify end to end data flow.

10. TESTING
10.1 Functional Testing
Check GPS accuracy and signal stability. Verify data refresh interval and
dashboard updates.
10.2 Performance Testing
Measure latency between transmission and display. Ensure stable operation
during continuous vehicle motion.
11. LIMITATIONS
System depends on cellular or WiFi coverage. GPS accuracy reduces in tunnels or
blocked areas.
12. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
Integration with machine learning models. Battery powered long■range LoRaWAN
support. Automated maintenance scheduling systems.
13. CONCLUSION
TrackFleet demonstrates an academic prototype of an IoT based fleet monitoring
system and provides a foundation for future predictive maintenance research.
