FarmAuto - Smart Irrigation and Resource Optimization System

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
FarmAuto is a smart irrigation and resource optimization system designed to
support farmers by automating water distribution based on real time soil moisture
and environmental conditions. The system reduces water wastage, improves crop
yield consistency, and supports rural agricultural development using cost effective
IoT technology. FarmAuto aligns with government goals of sustainable farming,
digital transformation, and resource conservation.
2. BACKGROUND AND NEED ASSESSMENT
Agricultural water consumption represents a significant portion of freshwater usage
in many countries. Traditional irrigation practices rely on manual estimation and
fixed schedules, often leading to over irrigation or water scarcity. Small and
medium scale farmers lack access to advanced monitoring tools due to high cost
barriers. FarmAuto addresses this gap through low cost IoT based sensing and
automated irrigation control.
3. LITERATURE REVIEW
Several research studies demonstrate that soil moisture based irrigation
significantly improves water efficiency. International case studies show successful
deployment of wireless sensor networks in precision agriculture. Recent studies
also highlight the role of IoT and remote monitoring in mitigating climate variability
impacts. However, many solutions remain costly, complex, or require continuous
connectivity, limiting rural adoption. FarmAuto introduces a simplified and scalable
model suitable for local implementation.
4. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Primary objectives include: 1. To implement a soil moisture driven irrigation system
using IoT sensors. 2. To monitor environmental parameters such as temperature
and humidity. 3. To automate irrigation based on threshold based rules. 4. To
provide dashboard access for remote monitoring and decision making. 5. To
reduce water consumption and improve crop yield sustainability.

5. SCOPE OF WORK
The project covers the development of sensing units, communication network,
irrigation control module, backend data processing, dashboard visualization, and
field deployment for pilot testing. It does not include chemical soil analysis or crop
specific advisory services in the initial phase.
6. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
FarmAuto consists of distributed soil moisture sensing nodes that transmit
readings to a central unit. Based on data thresholds, a relay driven pump controller
activates irrigation automatically. Data is stored in a backend database and
visualized through a dashboard for monitoring.
7. HARDWARE COMPONENTS
7.1 Microcontroller
ESP32 microcontroller with WiFi support for data transmission.
7.2 Sensors
Capacitive soil moisture sensor for water content levels. DHT22 for temperature
and humidity. Optional water flow sensor for usage measurement.
7.3 Actuation Unit
Relay module connected to water pump. Manual override switch for safety. Surge
protection recommended for stability.

7.4 Power Supply
Solar panel and battery storage for rural deployment. DC regulated supply option
for grid connected areas.
8. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
8.1 Firmware Logic
Tasks include: WiFi setup and reconnection handling. Sensor data sampling.
Threshold comparison for irrigation control. MQTT data publishing and pump
actuation commands.
8.2 Backend Service
A Python service subscribes to incoming readings, validates data, and writes into
InfluxDB. The service logs irrigation activation events for historical tracking.
8.3 Dashboard Visualization
Grafana dashboard supports: Soil moisture trend graphs. Daily irrigation activity
logs. Alerts for low moisture or abnormal patterns.
9. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
9.1 Phase 1: Prototype Development
Assembly of sensing and actuation modules. Firmware development and unit
testing. Initial calibration of soil moisture sensors.

9.2 Phase 2: Field Deployment
Installation at selected pilot farm. Farmer orientation and training. Data collection
for seasonal evaluation.
9.3 Phase 3: Evaluation and Reporting
Performance metrics include water consumption reduction and irrigation
frequency. Reports submitted to government evaluation committee.
10. EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND BENEFITS
Reduced water consumption. Improved crop yield consistency. Lower labor
dependency. Support for sustainability goals.
11. RISK ANALYSIS
Risks include sensor degradation due to soil exposure, power failures in remote
areas, and network unavailability. Mitigation includes waterproof housing, solar
backup, and offline fallback logic.
12. FUTURE EXPANSION
Integration with weather forecasting. Mobile application for farmer access. Machine
learning based irrigation prediction. Large scale deployment for community water
management.
13. CONCLUSION
FarmAuto presents a realistic smart irrigation solution tailored for rural adoption
and government supported sustainability initiatives.
