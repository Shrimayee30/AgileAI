1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
HealthInsight is an enterprise grade monitoring and analytics platform designed to
provide real time visibility into hospital operational metrics including bed
occupancy, ER wait times, ICU load, patient flow, and equipment utilization. The
system integrates data from existing HIS sources and streams updates to a
Grafana based dashboard for continuous monitoring.
2. BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS
Key requirements include: 1. Centralized real time visibility across departments. 2.
Role based dashboard access. 3. Automated alerts for threshold breaches. 4. Data
retention and compliance with HIPAA standards. 5. High availability and failure
recovery.
3. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
HealthInsight uses the following architecture: Data ingestion via secure API
connectors. Kafka streaming for real time event flow. Processing layer for
aggregation and validation. Storage in InfluxDB for time series retention.
Visualization via Grafana with RBAC enabled.
4. DATA ENGINEERING PIPELINE
Pipeline functions include: 1. Data standardization from multiple hospital systems.
2. Deduplication and anomaly flagging. 3. Time-based aggregation for hourly and
daily views. 4. Storage with retention policy for up to 12 months. 5. Backup and
archival workflow.
5. DASHBOARD DESIGN
Grafana dashboards include: ER wait time heatmaps. ICU utilization trend lines.
Bed availability by department. Critical alerts for patient overflow. Historical

occupancy comparison.
6. ALERTING AND AUTOMATION
Alerts configured: ICU load > 90 percent for 10 minutes. ER wait times exceeding
threshold. Equipment downtime notifications. Alerts sent via SMS, email, and
webhook.
7. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES
Phase 1: Requirements and integration assessment. Phase 2: Data pipeline and
connector deployment. Phase 3: Dashboard and alert configuration. Phase 4: UAT
and rollout. Phase 5: Training and maintenance handover.
8. COMPLIANCE AND SECURITY
Security measures: TLS encryption for all communication. Access control using
RBAC. Audit logging enabled. HIPAA aligned data handling.
9. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
Predictive modeling for patient surge. Machine learning based staffing
optimization. Mobile dashboard access. Integration with wearable patient monitors.
10. CONCLUSION
HealthInsight provides a scalable and secure healthcare monitoring platform,
facilitating proactive decision making and resource optimization.
