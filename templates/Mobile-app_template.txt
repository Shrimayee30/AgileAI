AgileAI Mobile Application Template (Strict Scope Version)

Purpose:
This template guides the model to transform a mobile app project description (e.g., PDF or extracted text) into a structured Agile output consisting of:
- Epic
- Features
- User Stories

It enforces strict grounding: all output must be traceable to the input. No hallucination, inference, or generic filler is allowed.

INPUT SPECIFICATION

Input Type:
- A single project description document (PDF or extracted text)

Required Content in Input:
- App name or purpose
- List of screens, tabs, or modules to be built
- Functional requirements for each screen
- Technologies or integrations (e.g., biometric login, push notifications)
- User roles or flows (optional)

Strict Input Rules:
- The input must be treated as the sole source of truth
- Only generate output elements that are explicitly described in the input
- Do not infer or invent screens, components, or tasks

OUTPUT SPECIFICATION

Output Format:
Plain text structured as follows:

Epic:
[Name or purpose of the mobile application — must be explicitly stated or clearly implied in the input]

Features:
[List of screens, tabs, or modules — only those explicitly mentioned in the input]

User Stories:
[For each feature, list small, achievable development tasks. These should reflect real implementation work and be phrased as sprint-ready titles.]

Feature: [Feature Name] (Child of Epic)
- Create the header for [Feature Name] (Child of Feature)
- Add the footer for [Feature Name] (Child of Feature)
- Build the body layout for [Feature Name] (Child of Feature)
- Add navigation bar to [Feature Name] (only if navigation is mentioned)
- Add form fields to [Feature Name] (only if forms are mentioned)
- Connect [Feature Name] to local or remote database (only if data is mentioned)
- Add validation logic for [Feature Name] (only if input validation is described)
- Integrate [specific component] into [Feature Name] (only if mentioned)

DEFINITIONS

Epic:
- The name or purpose of the mobile application
- Must be explicitly stated or clearly implied in the input
- Example: Mobile Banking App, Fitness Tracker, Event Booking App

Feature:
- A distinct screen, tab, or module of the mobile app
- Must be explicitly mentioned in the input
- Each Feature is a child of the Epic
- Examples: Login Screen, Dashboard, Transaction History, Profile Settings

User Story:
- A small, actionable development task tied to a specific feature
- Must be grounded in the input document
- Each User Story is a child of a Feature
- Should be phrased as a sprint-ready title (imperative, implementation-focused)
- Examples: Add biometric login to Login Screen, Build transaction list layout for Dashboard, Connect Profile Settings to user database

CONSTRAINTS

- Strict grounding: Every Epic, Feature, and User Story must be traceable to the input document
- No hallucination: Do not invent screens, components, or tasks
- No generic filler: Avoid adding default elements like “Settings Screen” or “Search Bar” unless explicitly mentioned
- Domain-aware phrasing: Use task formats appropriate to mobile development (e.g., “Add toggle”, “Connect to database”, “Build layout”)

SAMPLE TRAINING EXAMPLE

### Input:
Project Description:
This mobile application enables users to manage their digital banking needs. It includes screens for Login, Dashboard, Account Summary, Transaction History, Fund Transfer, Bill Payments, Profile Settings, and Notifications. Users can log in using biometric authentication, view account balances, transfer funds between accounts, pay bills, and update personal information. The app supports push notifications for transaction alerts and uses secure APIs to connect to the bank’s backend systems.
