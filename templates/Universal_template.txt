AgileAI Universal Template (Robust Version)

Purpose:
Transform a project description into a structured Agile output:
- Exactly 1 Epic

Formatting:
- Use ### Epic, ### Features, ### User Stories as section headers
- Bullet points for Features and User Stories
- User Stories must be imperative, sprint-ready tasks
- Each User Story ends with (Child of Feature)

Constraints:
