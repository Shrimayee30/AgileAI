AgileAI IoT System Template (Strict Scope Version)

Purpose:
This template guides the model to transform a project description document (e.g., PDF or extracted text) for an IoT system into a structured Agile output consisting of:
- Epic
- Features
- User Stories

It enforces strict grounding: all output must be traceable to the input. No hallucination, inference, or generic filler is allowed.

INPUT SPECIFICATION

Input Type:
- A single project description document (PDF or extracted text)

Required Content in Input:
- Purpose or goal of the IoT system
- Devices, modules, or control units involved
- Functional requirements or automation logic
- Technologies, sensors, or protocols used
- User roles or control interfaces (optional)

Strict Input Rules:
- The input must be treated as the sole source of truth
- Only generate output elements that are explicitly described in the input
- Do not infer or invent devices, components, or tasks

OUTPUT SPECIFICATION

Output Format:
Plain text structured as follows:

Epic:
[Purpose or goal of the IoT system — must be explicitly stated or clearly implied in the input]

Features:
[List of devices, modules, or control units — only those explicitly mentioned in the input]

User Stories:
[For each feature, list small, achievable development tasks. These should reflect real implementation work and be phrased as sprint-ready titles.]

Feature: [Feature Name] (Child of Epic)
- [User Story 1] (Child of Feature)
- [User Story 2] (Child of Feature)
- ...

DEFINITIONS

Epic:
- A concise, high-level title that summarizes the overall goal of the IoT system
- Must reflect the main deliverable or purpose
- Example: Home Automation System, Smart Irrigation Controller, Industrial Sensor Network

Feature:
- A major device, module, or control unit in the IoT system
- Must be explicitly mentioned in the input
- Each Feature is a child of the Epic
- Examples: Lighting Control, Thermostat Module, Security Camera, Voice Assistant Integration

User Story:
- A small, actionable development task tied to a specific feature
- Must be grounded in the input document
- Each User Story is a child of a Feature
- Should be phrased as a sprint-ready title (imperative, implementation-focused)
- Examples: Connect motion sensor to lighting module, Configure temperature thresholds for thermostat, Enable voice commands for door lock

CONSTRAINTS

- Strict grounding: Every Epic, Feature, and User Story must be traceable to the input document
- No hallucination: Do not invent devices, components, or tasks
- No generic filler: Avoid adding default elements like “Settings Panel” unless explicitly mentioned
- Domain-aware phrasing: Use task formats appropriate to IoT workflows (e.g., “Connect sensor”, “Configure threshold”, “Send alert”)

SAMPLE TRAINING EXAMPLE

### Input:
Project Description:
This IoT system automates key functions in a smart home. It includes modules for lighting control, thermostat regulation, door security, and voice assistant integration. The lighting module uses motion sensors to turn lights on/off. The thermostat module adjusts temperature based on user preferences and time of day. The door security module includes a smart lock and camera feed. The system integrates with Alexa for voice commands. Data is logged to a cloud dashboard for monitoring.
