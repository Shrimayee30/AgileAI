AgileAI Web Application Template (Strict Scope Version)

Purpose:
This template guides the model to transform a project description document (e.g., PDF or extracted text) for a web application into a structured Agile output consisting of:
- Epic
- Features
- User Stories

It enforces strict grounding: all output must be traceable to the input. No hallucination, inference, or generic filler is allowed.

INPUT SPECIFICATION

Input Type:
- A single project description document (PDF or extracted text)

Required Content in Input:
- Project name or goal
- List of pages or modules to be built
- Functional requirements for each page
- Technologies or integrations (e.g., payment gateway, admin panel)
- User roles or interactions (optional)

Strict Input Rules:
- The input must be treated as the sole source of truth
- Only generate output elements that are explicitly described in the input
- Do not infer or invent components, pages, or tasks

OUTPUT SPECIFICATION

Output Format:
Plain text structured as follows:

Epic:
[Name of the web application — must be explicitly stated or clearly implied in the input]

Features:
[List of pages or modules — only those explicitly mentioned in the input]

User Stories:
[For each feature, list small, achievable development tasks. These should reflect real implementation work and be phrased as sprint-ready titles.]

Feature: [Feature Name] (Child of Epic)
- Create the header for [Feature Name] (Child of Feature)
- Add the footer for [Feature Name] (Child of Feature)
- Build the body layout for [Feature Name] (Child of Feature)
- Add sidebar navigation to [Feature Name] (only if sidebar is mentioned)
- Add internal links to [Feature Name] (only if links are mentioned)
- Connect [Feature Name] to database (only if data storage is mentioned)
- Add form validation to [Feature Name] (only if forms are mentioned)
- Integrate [specific component] into [Feature Name] (only if mentioned)

DEFINITIONS

Epic:
- A concise, high-level title that summarizes the overall goal of the project
- Must reflect the main deliverable or purpose
- Example: E-Commerce Website for Fashion Retail, Online Learning Portal

Feature:
- A distinct page or module of the web application
- Must be explicitly mentioned in the input
- Each Feature is a child of the Epic
- Examples: Home Page, Login/Register Page, Product Catalog, Checkout Page, Admin Dashboard

User Story:
- A small, actionable development task tied to a specific feature
- Must be grounded in the input document
- Each User Story is a child of a Feature
- Should be phrased as a sprint-ready title (imperative, implementation-focused)
- Avoid persona-based phrasing (e.g., “As a user…”)
- Examples: Create the header for Home Page, Build the body layout for Checkout Page, Connect Product Catalog Page to database

CONSTRAINTS

- Strict grounding: Every Epic, Feature, and User Story must be traceable to the input document
- No hallucination: Do not invent or infer any components, pages, modules, or tasks
- No generic filler: Avoid adding default elements like “Settings Page” or “Search Bar” unless explicitly mentioned
- Domain-aware phrasing: Use task formats appropriate to web development (e.g., “Create header”, “Connect to database”)

SAMPLE TRAINING EXAMPLE

### Input:
Project Description:
This project describes the design and implementation of an e-commerce website for fashion and lifestyle products (currently men's wear). Users can browse products, register, log in, add items to a shopping cart, and complete purchases using PayPal or Cash on Delivery. The site includes pages for Home, Clothing (Products), Order Us, Contact Us, About Us, Track (Admin), Register, Login, Admin Dashboard, Order View, Payment (PayPal), Success, and Failure. Technologies used include ASP.NET, C#.NET, SQL Server 2008, and ADO.NET. The system supports three roles: Visitor, User, and Admin. Admins can manage products, users, and orders.
