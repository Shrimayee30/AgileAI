AgileAI Data Science Template (Strict Scope Version)

Purpose:
This template guides the model to transform a project description document (e.g., PDF or extracted text) for a data science project into a structured Agile output consisting of:
- Epic
- Features
- User Stories

It enforces strict grounding: all output must be traceable to the input. No hallucination, inference, or generic filler is allowed.

INPUT SPECIFICATION

Input Type:
- A single project description document (PDF or extracted text)

Required Content in Input:
- Purpose or goal of the data science project
- Workflow stages or modules (e.g., data ingestion, cleaning, analysis, visualization, reporting)
- Functional requirements or tasks within each stage
- Technologies, datasets, or metrics used
- Business questions or decision goals (optional)

Strict Input Rules:
- The input must be treated as the sole source of truth
- Only generate output elements that are explicitly described in the input
- Do not infer or invent stages, components, or tasks

OUTPUT SPECIFICATION

Output Format:
Plain text structured as follows:

Epic:
[Purpose or goal of the data science project — must be explicitly stated or clearly implied in the input]

Features:
[List of workflow stages or modules — only those explicitly mentioned in the input]

User Stories:
[For each feature, list small, achievable development tasks. These should reflect real implementation work and be phrased as sprint-ready titles.]

Feature: [Feature Name] (Child of Epic)
- [User Story 1] (Child of Feature)
- [User Story 2] (Child of Feature)
- ...

DEFINITIONS

Epic:
- A concise, high-level title that summarizes the overall goal of the data science project
- Must reflect the main deliverable or purpose
- Example: Sales Analysis Dashboard, Customer Segmentation Study

Feature:
- A major workflow stage or module of the data science pipeline
- Must be explicitly mentioned in the input
- Each Feature is a child of the Epic
- Examples: Data Ingestion, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Analysis, Visualization, Reporting

User Story:
- A small, actionable development task tied to a specific feature
- Must be grounded in the input document
- Each User Story is a child of a Feature
- Should be phrased as a sprint-ready title (imperative, implementation-focused)
- Examples: Load sales data from CSV, Remove null values from revenue column, Create bar chart of monthly sales

CONSTRAINTS

- Strict grounding: Every Epic, Feature, and User Story must be traceable to the input document
- No hallucination: Do not invent stages, components, or tasks
- No generic filler: Avoid adding default elements like “Export to PDF” unless explicitly mentioned
- Domain-aware phrasing: Use task formats appropriate to data workflows (e.g., “Clean column”, “Plot trend”, “Group by region”)

SAMPLE TRAINING EXAMPLE

### Input:
Project Description:
This data science project analyzes retail sales data to uncover trends and support business decisions. It includes stages for data ingestion, cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and reporting. The dataset contains transaction-level data including date, product category, region, quantity sold, and revenue. The goal is to identify seasonal trends, top-performing regions, and product categories. The final output is a dashboard with interactive charts and summary tables. Tools used include Python, pandas, matplotlib, and Power BI.

### Output:
Epic:
Sales Analysis Dashboard

Features:
- Data Ingestion
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Analysis
- Visualization
